# Random User Generator App

## Overview

This Android application is designed to demonstrate modern Android development practices by fetching
and displaying randomly generated user data. It utilizes
the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/), a free API for generating random user data,
to showcase network requests, data presentation, and following the MVVM architectural pattern in
Android development.

## Features

- **Random User Data**: Fetches random user data from the Random User Generator API.
- **Modern UI**: Displays user information, including images, names, and contact details, in a
  user-friendly interface.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Adheres to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern for
  efficient and maintainable code structure.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Uses ViewModel to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious
  manner, ensuring smooth orientation changes and UI state management.
- **Image Loading**: Integrates Glide for efficient and smooth image loading and rendering.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, clone
the repository and import it into Android Studio.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-user-generator-app
```

Ensure you have an active internet connection for fetching data from the Random User Generator API.

## Dependencies

- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, used for API requests.
- **ViewModel**: Part of Android Jetpack, manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Glide**: An efficient image loading library for Android.
- **ConstraintLayout**: Used for creating complex and flexible UI layouts.
- **LiveData**: Lifecycle-aware data holder class, ensuring UI matches data state.

## How It Works

- **API Integration**: The app uses Retrofit to fetch data from the Random User Generator API.
- **Data Display**: User data is displayed in a format that includes profile pictures, names, and
  contact details.
- **ViewModel**: Handles data-fetching logic and serves as an interface between the API and the UI.
- **Glide**: Manages image loading and caching for smooth performance.

## Architecture

Following the MVVM architecture, the app separates data handling logic (ViewModel and Repository)
from UI logic (Activities and Views), ensuring a clean and testable codebase. The ViewModel
communicates with the repository to fetch data, which is then observed and displayed in the UI.
